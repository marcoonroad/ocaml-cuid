### Installation

If available on OPAM, it's easily installed with:

```shell
$ opam install cuid
```

Otherwise, this library is also installable using
JBuilder within this root directory:

```shell
$ jbuilder install
```

### Usage

As library:

```ocaml
let cuid = Cuid.generate ( )
(* cuid is "c00p6veue0000072slgr067a3", for example *)
```

There's also an implementation of CUID slugs. They fit in cases
where collision resistance is not important and when they are not
generated too frequently. For instance, we can use them as URL
suffixes for blog posts. To generate a CUID slug, just use:

```ocaml
let slug = Cuid.slug ( )
(* slug is "u90m0y0m", for example *)
```

### Conclusion

PRs & issues are welcome. Have fun and imagine Sisyphus happy.
